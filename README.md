# 1.6. Generics (Level 1 - Exercise 2)

## Project Description üìÑ

This Java project solves the following exercise:

"Create a class called Person with the attributes name, surname and age. Then create a class called GenericMethods with a generic method that accepts three generic arguments. This method should only print on screen the arguments it has received. In main() of the main class, call the generic method with different types of parameters.

Example: an object of the Person class, a String and a primitive type.

In this way you have checked that you can pass any type of parameter and in any order".

The goal is to gain practical experience with generic programming in Java, which is essential for writing flexible and reusable code, especially when working with collections and libraries that rely on generics (like ArrayList<T> or Map<K, V>).
